Adapted parts, each modified for HappyClaw (every adapted file says so in its
header):

- `shared/model-providers.ts`: the vendor preset catalog, the model
  capability table (context windows and reasoning efforts), the model list
  parsing and the upstream error classification.
- `web/src/components/chat/composer/cindy/`: the chat composer's editor core
  (list nodes, punctuation and selection plugins, reference and long-paste
  chips, Markdown serialization, palette matching, the send button) and its
  tests.

## Vendor marks

`web/src/components/brand/vendorMarks.ts` holds the vendor marks shown next to
model connections and models. Brand marks remain their owners' trademarks and
are used only to identify the vendor.
